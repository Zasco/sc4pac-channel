  description: |
    Based on various plugins I've found, this plugin contains 4 small (1x1) waterfall lots that can be placed on cliffs to simulate a waterfall on land. All waterfalls can be placed on any slope, even on water (if the bottom part of the cliff is in the sea), to facilitate creating a transition to the sea. They should be able to be combined with most available ploppable water pieces and water mods.
    For further information, please refer to the Readme files in the download.
    Available languages: Both the readmes and the in-game description texts are available in English and German.
