    Temple props: debussyman
    Lotting: 11241036
    Version: 1a
    Description:
    I found these nice temple props made by @debussyman by coincidence among my plugins. Since I couldn't find any plugin uploaded on the STEX containing lots with these props (except the Temple of the STEX Goddess), I just decided to make my own. This plugin contains 4 ploppable lots in the Landmark menu, each with a temple and a few decorations. They don't do anything special, but they have some landmark effect. The internal prop names refer to 4 people/deities from ancient Greek mythology; I decided to keep these names.
    For exact lot details, please read the Readme. This plugin is available in English and German, the game picks the language automatically.
