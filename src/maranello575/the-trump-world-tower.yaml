    Trump World Tower
    
    845 United Nations Plaza
    
    70th tallest building in the world (tallest residential tower in the world 2001 - 2002)
    
    Architect: Costas Kondylis
    Height: 861 ft (262 m), 72 floors, construction started: 1999, completed: 2001
    
    In reality this is an all residential building and seeing how they don't work as
    ploppables, I decided to release this as a CS$$ lot and a Landmark.
