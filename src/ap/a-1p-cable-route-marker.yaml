    These cable route markers are intended to work as an unobtrusive way to connect power assets or other infrastructure that requires electricity, but you wish to avoid pulling a power line there.
    The idea was to simulate an underground cable with the visual cable route marker signs in the landscape.
    The lots have no base-texture and can be fully covered by vegetation or other MMPs. The cable route markers are very small and barely visible as well.
    They come in 4 different varieties and change with every plop automatically.
