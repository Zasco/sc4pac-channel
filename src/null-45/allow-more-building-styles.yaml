info:
  summary: "A DLL Plugin for SimCity 4 that allows the game to use more than 4 building styles."
  description: >
    This DLL mod is intended as a dependency for other mods that add new building styles beyond the 4 that Maxis included, it does not add any building styles to the game by itself.
    
    Maxis programmed the Building Style Control UI to only recognize the check boxes of the 4 built-in styles, no matter how may check boxes are actually present. This mod patches the game's memory to remove that restriction.
