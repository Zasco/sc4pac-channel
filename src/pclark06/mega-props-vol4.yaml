  summary: "A new Mega Prop Pack, the highlight being about 1200 new car props."
  description: >
    A lot of them are upsized versions of my older car props to fit the SHK Parking Pack, as well as added ground shadows. I also added some modern cars as well as some new pre-2000 cars. There is a list of all the new car props in the ZIP file. I made many of these cars to complement @art128's Pre-2000 Car Prop pack, as well as @Barroco Hispano's AGC DLC.
