    Lindsay Bros. was founded in 1884 and eventually became one of the largest manufacturers of agricultural implements in the United States. In 1892, the company constructed this factory building in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The building still stands in the city's Walker's Point neighborhood.
    This lot is wall-to-wall and modded for industrial (I-m), but would look right at home in a grittier commercial district as well.
    7x3 growable and ploppable I-m lots
    Provides 348 jobs
    MaxisNite and DarkNite versions included
    DarkNite requires the Day and Nite Modd
