info:
  summary: "Use these lots to reserve space for future development."
  description: >
    The lots are completely neutral, providing no positive or negative effects. There is no plop or bulldoze cost, though there is a $1 monthly cost (if you open the Landmarks budget, you can use this to tally how many of these lots you have plopped in a city).
    Four lots are included: 1x1, 2x2, 1x5, 5x5. Find these lots at the top of the Landmarks menu.
    There are four color options. Choose one of: purple, cyan, red, and white.
    For more information, including instructions to create your own colored texture, refer to the included readme file.
