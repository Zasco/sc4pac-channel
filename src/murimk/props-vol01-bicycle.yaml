    Murimk Bicycle Props
    For all who wish to introduce biycle-related items to their cities, here is the prop pack just for you. It is organized in different packages containing the following:
    Bikes (7 different colors)
    Bikers (straight and diagonal, in 7 different colors - timed to appear/disappear at certain times of the day)
    Stands (with varying number of bikes)
    Shop Stands (with advertisement and varying number of bikes)
    Bike Shelters (2 types, with various colors)
    Shop Signs (2 variations)
    In addition to the single props you'll also find prop-families for most items, as well as a MayorMode Ploppable (MMP) set for the bikers.
    All props are named with the prefix 'MUR' to easily locate them in LE.
    The props from this pack can be used to make your own lots. Do not include them in your upload though - please point to this pack as a dependency.
