    Classic villas like this can be found in rather posh areas of the Netherlands. Or in other countries for that matter... I imagine this wouldn't look out of place in any European style town. It's a relot of an older building by the great @Haarlemmergold
    Capacity satisfied: R$44, R$26, R$$13. It should grow on any tileset.
    The attached screenshots show my custom pavement (created through @rsc204's MTRDK) and grass (Lowkee's Appalachian terrain mod). As far as I know the used texture ID's are standard, so it should work whether or not you're using particular mods. Let me know in the comments if you run into any trouble!
