    Konsum is a Swedish cooperative grocery store. This ploppable 2x2 lot fits on a street corner. The store has a loading dock in the back, which is accessed through the parking area. Sims are also able to park their bikes in the front. It offers 37 C$ jobs.
    The attached screenshots show my custom pavement (created through @rsc204's MTRDK) and grass (Lowkee's Appalachian terrain mod). As far as I know the used texture ID's are standard, so it should work whether or not you're using particular mods. Let me know in the comments if you run into any trouble!
