    Wells Fargo Plaza
    Based on the real life building in Bloomington, MN, USA
    BAT by IDS2
    Lot/modding/testing by T Wrecks
    So, after over a year of relentlessly tweaking this thing, I'm finally feeling gutsy enough to upload it 
    This 300-or-so foot tall midrise office tower is pretty closely based off of its real life counterpart located in a large business corridor in the city of Bloomington in my lovely home state of Minnesota. Built in 1974, it is currently the 2nd-tallest building in the state located outside of either downtown Minneapolis or St. Paul.
    Growable and ploppable version included! Both provide 5,676 CO$ jobs on a 5x10 lot (transit enabled, baby!)
    This zip file contains Maxisnite and Darknite versions. Darknite version requires Simfox's Day n' Night mod in order to function properly.
    Dependencies:
    BSC Mega Props CP Vol.1 (for virtually all props)
    NDEX Essentials (for the base texture)
    Simfox Day n' Night mod (for Darknite version)
    Modeled in 3dsMax.
    This is my first upload, so if anything is wrong with the building (this also goes for any subsequent uploads), please PM me 
    My most sincere thanks go out to T Wrecks who kindly gave this building a breath of life with his spiffy lotting skills  In addition, I would like to thank all the kind people in my BAT thread who have supported me over the past year. I couldn't have done it without you guys!
