    Built in 1963, these apartments sit just off of highway 94 a few blocks east of downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota. Though they are closer to the freeway, they are easy to miss next to the far more prominent Riverside Plaza complex, which was designed by local architect Ralph Rapson.
    This pack contains four variations on a single building layout: two that are ten stories and two that are five. The real-world building off which these are based is closest in appearance to the Powderhorn Building, but to create some more variety, I have also made a version in red brick for each the five-story and ten-story variants. The ten-story variants (Powderhorn and Loring) both house 1412 R$ sims, while the five-story variants house 636 R$ sims. All of the lots are 5X2 and are provided as growables. Both Darknite and Maxisnite options are provided - use only one at a time!
