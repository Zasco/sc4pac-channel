    Dollarama is a Canadian dollar store retail chain headquartered in Montreal. Since 2009, it has been Canada's 2nd largest retailer of items for four dollars or less. I've had this building for a couple of years, so, from the vault, it's pretty much as-is. I think it's only a CS$ growable, stage one. @RRetail did the lotting a while back.
