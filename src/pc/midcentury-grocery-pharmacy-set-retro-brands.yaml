    Similar to the Australian retail set I did, I wanted to use the same base building to create some regional American supermarkets around this size. Grocery stores nowadays are massive but the base building goes back to a time when these stores were much smaller, and which, many still exist whether a pharmacy is using that space, or whether it's a smaller regional grocery chain that prides itself on customer service. These are retro brands that are either defunct, or have few locations remaining after mergers. There are 30 classic grocery stores in this set.
    If you use lotplop, you can access all these as plop buildings. Grow lots are 3x6 and plop lots are 7x6.
