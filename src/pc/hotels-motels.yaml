    It's time to add variety to your tourists and your business travelers and where they stay. This set of hotels and motels contains over 100 different variations over 10 separate models. The lots are CS$ and CS$ (plans for the future include a CS$ set). Hotel branding changes so frequently that I figured there needed to be a set of new hotels.
