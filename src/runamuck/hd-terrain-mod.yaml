    HD Terrain MOD.....
    Description.....
    Ahh, that default terrain, great for Motocross, Survivalist and Junkyards but, you do have a choice, everybody; Green acres is the place to be, SimCity is the life for me, land stretching out so far and wide, forget about Maxis - give me this countryside! This MOD has been developed and tested with Windows XP, running SimCity 4 Deluxe.
