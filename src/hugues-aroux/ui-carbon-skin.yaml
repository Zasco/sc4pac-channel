  summary: "This Mod replaces the SC4 interface. Its dominant colors are Anthracite and Gray."
  description: >
    More than a simple graphic layer, CarbonSkin offers light retouching, corrections and repositioning of interface objects. Also slight adjustments to fonts (+1|2 points).
    Nothing too disruptive for this version (the next one perhaps :ooh:). And a new icon set. “old”* players will find their way there.
    The choice of gray, rather than full anthracite, is a compromise with my original intention. It should be noted that certain «Budget» windows are generated in the EXE
    where the text color is forced to Maxis Blue. In addition, hundreds of query windows and buttons (partially) personalized in the plugins - follow my gaze to the BSC team ;-) - retain the Maxis colors, ... !!
    What this interface does or does not do
    CarbonSkin doesn’t make your breakfast, even though its round head looks like a coffee maker.
    It does not support the small screen interface (800x600), «tutorial» mode, Developer
    mode or non-transparent mode - details below.
