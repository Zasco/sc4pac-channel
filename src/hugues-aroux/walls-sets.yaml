  summary: "This plugin offers Lots of “Walls on Slopes” in 6 sets of textures."
  description: >
    This plugin offers Lots of “Walls on Slopes” in 6 sets of textures:
    Sandstone, Granite, Brick, Concrete, Rubble and Retaining
    (see attached illustrations).
    Each set has around 35 pieces, it depends... of my mood. The textures adapt to the different shapes that the Terrain tiles can take. Lots are of several types:
      Straight – 1 to 3 variations,
      Intermediate straight (without wall, parapet or fence),
      Stairs - (pedestrian Transit Enable) simple and double tile ramp from MAS71,
      Diagonal Top - 1 to 4 variations of the ground,
      Diagonal Bottom - 1 to 4 var' + L|R ends of wall pieces,
      Inner corner,
      Outer corner (rare that one... isn’t it!) - with L|R ends of wall,
      Filler - to «close» a space or extend the parapet on the flat (or not) tiles,
      Transition - joining two (textures) walls,
      Underbridge - from the left/right for 3 terrain heights: 8, 15 and 22 m.
    I would like to mention here the contribution of @rsc204 which offered the small, but no less essential, Prop which made it possible to manufacture the «underbridges» quickly and easily. For your pleasure .. and mine!
    Speaking of Bridge, the Sandstone, Concrete and Retaining sets are «floodable», meaning that several pieces of this set can be placed on submerged Terrain tiles (Maxis water).
    Speaking of water, diagonal pieces (for all sets) come with either a grassy/sidewalk half or «empty»!
    That is to say that part of it is transparent and allows the Terrain to be seen. This implies, in a standard game situation, the appearance of the «water bug» after using the Pipes tool... Unless of course you use the solution proposed here:
    .. Simtropolis <coris-partial-water-bug-fix> Topic ..
    Otherwise, well... don’t use these Lots! You have been warned ;-)!
