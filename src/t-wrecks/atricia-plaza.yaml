  description: >
    The original building was a CO$$, so I decided to take that old building, get rid of the palm trees, whip up an entirely new lot and convert it from CO§§§ to a R§§ with a high occupant number - 5,800 to be precise. Well, it's very high, it's on a 4x6 lot, so it can hold many people. It grows in the two modern tilesets, i.e. Houston and Euro.
