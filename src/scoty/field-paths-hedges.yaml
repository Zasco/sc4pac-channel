    Tracks on grass without transparency!
    This little plugin of 32 Lots, proposes a field path lined with hedges (bushes, trees). To create bocages. The tracks are adapted to the tractors proposed by the VIP and Namspopof team. They can be found for example in Fantozzi’s farms (Colossus Farming). And won’t be too disturbing with SPAM. The set of Lots includes ortho, diag, and various junctions with streets.
    These traces are of course on grass, but what grass?
    Let’s now turn to the thought that brought me here and to ask RIVIT:
    You all know the «water bug» that occurs when you remove the basetexture from a Lot. Some of you get used to it, I don’t! It annoys me! So I wanted to be able to
    create textures that fit the grass of the Mod Terrain that I chose for my cities/rural areas.
    As you know, SC4 doesn’t reproduce on screen the color values we created under photohop. That’s where RIVIT comes in. He has calculated the right Curve to transform
    a Terrain texture into a texture that can be used in a Lot, which will blend in with its environment as well as possible.
    All useful information about @rivit work, and the photoshop curve file, is in the ZIP that comes with this plugin in the footer attachment :
    «convert_Terrain_inLot.zip».
    So for these Lots I have assigned a grass texture base (basetexture 0xf8e06e34) in a separate .dat file. Whose content can be replaced by the grass/soil (FSH) that suits you. I have prepared 5 versions of this texture from known Mod Terrain, plus the one from Maxis. I could extend the supply, on demand! Beware, this has its limits depending on the Terrain Mods, as shown in the image of the Pyrenean and Wasco Mod, which offers a variant texture for the same altitude.
