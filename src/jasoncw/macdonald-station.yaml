    MacDonald Station is derived from my Telus Plaza upload, and has been made into a separate lot for increased playability. In real life it's an office building, but I have made it into a police station. It's comparable in size to Maxis's Large Police Station, and so it is comparable in stats, although the radius has been increased.
    • 3x3 police station.
    • MaxisNite and DarkNite night versions included.
    • Dark Nite requires the Day and Nite Modd.
