info:
  summary: "This set will make it possible to construct a double-sided perimeter fence around special industries, airports, prisons, secret facilities or anything else you want to protect."
  description: >
    The set has seven pieces:
      1x1 straight
      2x1 straight
      1x1 outer curve
      1x1 inner curve
      1x1 inner gate (access to inner area)
      3x2 main gate (eyecandy)
      2x1 main gate (transit enabled)
    Also included is a set of four path textures - concrete (default), asphalt, red stone and plain dirt.
    Choose one of the textures only (or rename the one you want to use with the prefix 'z_...', i.e. 'z_asphalt.dat'). You can exchange the texture for another one any time, no need to re-plop the lots.
    Make sure the 'keep_this_texture.dat' is installed all the time, as it contains the custom overlays.
    Of course you can also change the path texture with anything you please using LotEditor.
    The eyecandy gate can be used for any buildings that don't need direct road access. For all others you can use the transit enabled gate.
