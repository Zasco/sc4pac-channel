  summary: "This is a set of overlay textures (for pathways) and is a dependency for many of my lots and sets."
  author: "paeng"
  description: >
    The overlays are for paths of all kinds - narrow and wide paths, straight, curve, tee, cross, diagonal, wide-to-narrow-transitions etc.
    This updated version maintains all textures from the previous version and now includes a number of additional matching overlays for more intricate path-variations. Plus some... ;-)
    All you need to do is to remove the previous file -
      Paeng_Textures_v103.dat (old)
    and replace it with the one from this upload -
      Paeng_TexturePack_v104.dat (current)
    No further action required :-)
    Lot designers are free to utilize these textures, but the DAT file is not to be included with any download package. Please link to this upload instead.
