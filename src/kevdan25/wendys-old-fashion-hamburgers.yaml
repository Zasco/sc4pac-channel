    When Dave Thomas opened the first 'Wendys Old Fashioned Hamburgers' restaurant. he had created something new and different in the restaurant industry.  He offered high quaility food made with the freshest ingredients and served the way the customer wanted it.
     To Dave, quality was so important that he put the phrase 'Quality is our Recipe' on the logo.  Dave had an uncompromising passion for quality food, people and the way we run our business. His passion for quality remains our number one priority at every Wendy's restaurant around the world. And it all began in 1969 with one restaurant in Columbus, Ohio.
    This Wendys comes ploppable with 75 jobs and is a 3x4 LM lot also included is a CS$ 3x3 Growable. I tried to make this as realistic as possible by using custom props, textures and lighting. Hope you enjoy! I have also used the American Flag prop that some of you take offense to.  I am American and my lots reflect those of American institutions please don't be offended by this just enjoy the lot.  Merry Christmas everyone.
