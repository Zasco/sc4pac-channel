    TG Elanto HQ (made by Krio) is the head office of Elanto, a retailing co-operative giant. Building is based on office building in southern Helsinki on the Bulevardi-street and some of my own design.
    Special feature that the ploppable version of the lot is working as an active subway station within an commercial office building. The growable version does NOT have this feature, that's just a regular commercial office lot.
    Model by Krio
    Lotting and modding by Tyberius06
