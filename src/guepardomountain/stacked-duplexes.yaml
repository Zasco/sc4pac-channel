  summary: "This small duplex, featuring one home on each story, is based on floorplan #2U-5 from William P. Dingledy's \"Duplex and income units\" vintage floorplan catalog that can be found here (that link should work whenever the Internet Archive comes back online!)."
  description: >
    I made two color variations: yellow walls with black roof, and white walls with red roof. For additional variety, there is also a mirrored version of each. A single building will grow on a 1x2 lot. There is also a 3x4 lot with eight duplexes.
