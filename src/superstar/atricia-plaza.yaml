    Finally!!! The first Superstar GX BAT is out to the open....
    I first showed off this BAT in Superstars Super BATs thread, this was because this BAT was made using Generation 1 and 2 BAT* skills as the change came as I was half way done with this....
    Now, the 'Atricia Plaza' is a very nice looking building....
    It has a nice cool lot, planted well by palm trees and the famous globe wich lays at the back...
    This building is a CO$$ with around 5000-6000 jobs for all your sims
    This BAT has a plopable and Growable version so any one you like use!
    That is all I have to say about the 'Atricia Plaza', hope you guys like it, many more BAT on the way, look out 'Superstar GX' is in buis!
