    Apparently, we are all pronouncing it wrong....instead of saying it as 'eye-kee-ah', it should be 'ee-kay-uh'. Who knew?
    
    This is based on a real building in Sydney's suburbs. The building is accurate, but the car-park/lot is slightly reduced in size by about 2 tiles to avoid running into the maximum number of items that can be placed in a file. Despite this, it is still a very hefty lot of 18x18.
    
    It takes up a lot of real estate, but it provides a lot of jobs (1,472 across all wealth levels) and a lot of city wide benefits.
    
    Therefore, it is offered as a reward. 
    Had I made it a simple ploppable with jobs it would actually have negative effects on regional demand for commercial services/commercial offices; whereas the civic jobs provide employment while keeping your CS/CO demand completely in tact. 
    
    Like 95% of my rewards, this is offered without needing to meet pre-existing conditions and does not over-write any Maxis reward.
    
    Because everyone, even a SIM, loves spending a full day getting lost at IKEA, it also provides other city and regional benefits by driving up R$ and R$$ demand meaning that you'll enjoy more city growth by placing this reward.
