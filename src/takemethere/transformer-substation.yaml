  summary: "Have you ever wanted to properly end your power lines with a transformer substation? Well now you can!"
  description: >
    By previous request I'm releasing this file which I first displayed on my CJ a while back. Originally the plan was to include this lot as part of a set of several different types of transitions(1-line, 2-line, 2-way, 4-way etc.) for both the in-game maxis power lines and also MandelSoft's custom power line set. However I've decided to abandon that much delayed project in favor of a completely new custom power line set I'm currently working on.
    This substation can be used to properly cap the beginning and end of your power lines using a couple of very simple BAT. The lot provides 400 units of power, the idea behind that being that while a substation doesn't actually generate power it plays an important part in prevent transmission power loses by stepping up and the reducing the voltages across a long distance power line. It can be found near the bottom of the power menu. No dependencies are required.
    Stats:
    Plop Cost: $400
    Power produced: 400 (8MW)
    Monthly Cost: $4
    Demolition cost: $100
