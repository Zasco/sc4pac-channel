    The United Nations Project Proudly Presents…
    The United Nations Building
    Contributors to the project include: Amthaak, Cockatoo, Jasoncw and SimFox
    And a special thanks goes to everyone in the  Simtropolis BAT forums who provided us with feedback, support and that  all important motivation to get stuff done…
    Overview:
    Finally… it’s done. After 18 months of modelling, texturing, lighting,  rendering, problems, more problems, hotfixes and caffeine, it gives me  great pleasure to finally be able to share with you the fruits of our  labour!
    The United Nations Building (or Headquarters) was constructed on a  dedicated site overlooking the banks of New York City's East River to  house the newly formed body in the wake of the Second World War. An icon  of modernist Architecture, the complex was collaboratively designed by a  group of leading Architects of the period, including Oscar Niemeyer and  even the famed Le Corbusier. At the time of its construction, the  complex was revolutionary in both building techniques and design, being  one of the first constructions in the world to sport a sleek modernist  exterior that is now common in cities all over the world. Aside from  occasional renovations and several additional structures, the complex  remains in much the same state today as it did almost 60 years ago.
    Done in much the same spirit as the real world building, we set out to  recreate the massive complex collaboratively. The foundations were laid  out in Australia with building plans being flown in from Finland. The  glass, marble and asphalt were all imported from the United States and  the fountain was especially made in France. This really was an  international effort.
    Just fitting into a single model file, the complex measures an enormous  18x11 SC4 tiles, making it one of the largest modes to ever be exported  for this game. Additionally, weighing in at a massive 14.5 million  polygons as well as utilising many of 3ds Max's more advanced features,  it's also one of the heaviest models ever exported, requiring no less  than 8GB of memory to resolve.
    We tried our best to re-create the complex with as much attention to  detail and accuracy as possible, and we hope you'll enjoy seeing our  creation in your cities.
