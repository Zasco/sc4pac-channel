  summary: "This is one of the series of new water texture mods that replace the game's default water textures."
  description: >
    These mods use a process similar to that which is used by the newer rock mods to create a more photo-realistic appearance for the game's water.
    This mod does not alter any of the game's default terrain properties. It simply combines a mixture of reduced scale and luminance for each subsequently lower zoom level that results in a highly realistic looki8ng water texture.
    The Clipper texture  is a slightly darker version of the Windjammer texture with a notably more pronounced surface texture. Its a tad less translucent in the shallows and becomes quite dark in deeper water. This texture works well for open  ocean areas, large harbors and wide rivers.
